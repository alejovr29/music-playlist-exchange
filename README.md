🚀 MVP Scope (First Version)

<br>
🧭 User Flow

- The user arrives at the website’s home page.

- After some exploration, they decide to create an account.

- Registration requires email, username, password, and date of birth.

- The user confirms their email to complete the registration.

- They fill in basic profile details like name and a short biography.

- They select favorite music genres from a list or write their own.

- They add or link a few favorite songs to create their first playlist, called “My Favourite Songs Ever.”

- They choose whether their playlist is public and sharable with others.

- The platform invites them to discover other users’ playlists.

- If a playlist matching their chosen genres exists, they receive one at random.

- If no match exists, the system invites them to add more genres or explore outside their favorites.

- When exploring a playlist, the user can:

- See the list of songs (or reveal them gradually for more surprise).

- Check details about the playlist owner (username, bio).

- Play each song and vote (like/dislike) after at least 5 seconds of playback.

- Every liked song is saved in a temporary list.

- At the end of the session, the user is asked whether to:

- Add these liked songs to an existing playlist (e.g., Favourites), or

- Create a new playlist to save them.

- The playlist owner receives feedback in the form of an average score based on positive and negative votes.
